# DOE AFDC: US Alt Fuel Stations by Fuel Type

# https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10332

# This chart shows the trend of U.S. alternative fueling stations by fuel type from 1992 to 2018. Propane stations were the most numerous until 2011, when they were surpassed by electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), or charging units. The growth in EVSE units accelerated starting in 2011, following the 2010 increase of plug-in electric vehicles offered by major automakers. 2016 experienced the largest growth for EVSE to support the growing electric vehicle population, followed closely by 2017 and 2018. The number of EVSE units is expected to increase as the population of electric vehicles continues to grow. The number of E85 stations has been increasing steadily since 2004, as the number of flex-fuel vehicles available from major manufacturers has increased. The number of CNG stations decreased between 1996 and 2006 (despite the increase in CNG sales during this time) largely because the average station size was increasing.

# Source: Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC), either directly (afdc.energy.gov/stations/states) or from historical Transportation Energy Data Books (www.osti.gov)
# Notes: Starting in 2011, electric charging equipment was counted by the outlet rather than by the geographical location (i.e., station). This is different than other fuels, which only count the geographical location regardless of how many dispensers or nozzles are on site.
